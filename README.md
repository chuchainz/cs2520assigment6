draw_cloud(x, y): This function takes in the coordinates of the upper left corner of a cloud, and then draws the cloud using ellipses and rectangles.

draw_net(x, y): This function takes in the coordinates of the upper left corner of a soccer net, and then draws the net using lines and loops.

draw_light_pole(x, y): This function takes in the coordinates of the upper left corner of a light pole, and then draws the pole and its lights using rectangles, ellipses, and lines.

draw_field(x1, y1, x2, y2): This function draws the soccer field using rectangles, stripes, and loops. It takes in optional arguments to specify the coordinates of the field, but defaults to the entire screen width and the bottom 70% of the screen height.

draw_fence(y, height): This function draws a fence at a specified height on the screen using polygons and lines. It takes in optional arguments to specify the y-coordinate and height of the fence, but defaults to 170 and 15, respectively.

draw_scoreboard(x, y, width, height, pad): This function draws a scoreboard at a specified location and size using rectangles and lines. It takes in optional arguments to specify the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height, and padding of the scoreboard, but defaults to 300, 40, 200, 90, and 2, respectively.
